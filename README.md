## Localizatin: What is problem with localization:
	1. Message (Error, info) from back end
	2. Update existing  meassage after released.
	3. Space: there some languae don't have space => all translate must put in 1 message. If we split it into multi message we will face with it.
	4. Format message (English: Left to right, Japan: Right to lef).
	5. Length of message will difference with each language => May be break UI
	6. There a some special word will not translate.
